# qstat-pretty

qstat-pretty is a parser and pretty-printer for the output of the Grid Engine `qstat` program. It will parse the XML output produced by `qstat -xml` and display it in a nice table.

## Getting started

  1. Check out qstat-pretty somewhere
  2. Run the following (with `python` being Python 2.7 or later):
      $ qstat -xml | python pstat
  3. ????
  4. Profit!

qstat-pretty is still in very early development, so give me a message if you have problems getting things to run.
